# PlayDate

Playing around with the PlayDate SDK.

### Got it!

Received Satuay April 23, 2022.  Enjoying _Bloom_.  First impressions of the
device - heavier than I expected. About the expected size.  The crank feels really
nice.  The screen is a little fiddly with getting the best light.  Pixels are 
TINY.  Sometimes need to get nose-to-nose with it to see small text

Now... what to actually program it?

* [ ] Still need to flesh out the Sampler with stuffs.  Now that I can see how big/small
      things actually are
* [ ] Timing / benchmarks for operations.  Like how is memory latency vs calculation?
      There's a ton of "use RAM not CPU" in the discord(s), but sometimes (remember the
      G5's "9th order polynomial vs one round trip to RAM" thing?  And that was over
      a decade and a half ago
* [ ] TNH - the case makes a nice little stand.
